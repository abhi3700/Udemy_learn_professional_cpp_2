# Conclusion
> __Highlight:__ can be used in functional programming

* can be used for many mathematical operations at once (while checking for errors) using `and_then()`
* compose output of one function with that of another function, using `map`
* type conversion from one type to another can be done for both `Ok` & `Err`.
